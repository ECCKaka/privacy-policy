    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Privacy-First Design</h3>

        <li>Audio recordings are stored locally in the app's secure storage area on your iPhone or iPad</li>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Because all processing happens locally on the device, no data is transmitted or stored by us.</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Your audio recordings and transcriptions are protected by your device's built-in security features, including encryption and device passcode/biometric authentication. Since data never leaves your device, it is not subject to network transmission risks.</p>
